To use the model, run the file gameplay with the html files found in data/season*.
The different files contains players from our simulation with Sampdoria.
This will give the top 5 players based on the predicted Current Ability (CA).

To create your own models, use CA-prediction.py with your own HTML files from FM24 or take on of the two which is located in data/train.
There are lines outcommented, which saves the model whihc can be used if parameters are to be compared.
